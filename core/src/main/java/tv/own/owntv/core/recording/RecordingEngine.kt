/**
 * The byte pump behind live recording: [tv.own.owntv.core.download.DownloadEngine]'s shape, with the
 * four differences a live stream forces (§1.3).
 *
 * 1. **A time-based stop.** A live `.ts` URL never returns end-of-body, so the recording ends at
 *    `stopMs` and nowhere else.
 * 2. **No `Range` resume.** Resuming a live stream at a byte offset is meaningless. A dropped
 *    connection re-requests from *now* and **appends**, leaving a gap in the file. The gap is honest
 *    and unavoidable, and a `.ts` survives it.
 * 3. **Its own queue.** Recordings must not be serialised behind a 6 GB film — `DownloadEngine`
 *    drains strictly one at a time, deliberately, and a film would eat the nine o'clock news.
 * 4. **Concurrency bounded by the provider, not by us** (D10). Several recordings run at once, up to
 *    what the playlist's `maxConnections` allows, with one stream kept back so the user can still
 *    watch — unless they have said otherwise.
 *
 * [RecordingDao] is the single source of truth, exactly as the download queue is: the engine holds no
 * queue of its own, it drains whatever rows are due.
